!!!OTL: Transposing music
!!
!! Music can be transposed with the transpose filter.
!!
!! To transpose the folling music up a perfect fifth, add the line:
!!     !!!filter: transpose -t P5
!! anywhere in the file.  Type alt-c (or option-c) to "compile" the
!! filter and place the result into the text editor.
!!
!! Try transposing down a minor third:
!!     !!!filter: transpose -t -m3
!! Equivalent using Base-40 interval class:
!!     !!!filter: transpose -b -11
!! If there is a key designation (*C: for C major in this case), then
!! you can use the -k option.  Here is how to transpose to F-sharp major:
!!     !!!filter: transpose -k f#
!! or to E-flat major:
!!     !!!filter: transpose -k e-
