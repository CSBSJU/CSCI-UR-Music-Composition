!!!OTL: Removing stems with the autostem filter.
!!
!! Sometimes it is useful to remove stems from musical data
!! and instead rely on default stemming algorithms to have a clean, 
!! minimal encoding of the data.
!!
!! Step 1:  Add the following line anywhere in the data:
!!             !!!filter: autostem -r
!!          The -r option removes explicit stem directions, leaving
!!          stem directions to the discretion of a notation renderer.
!!
!! Step 2: If you want to see the Humdrum data without stems, then type
!!          alt-c (or option-c).  This will "compile" the autostem filter
!!          command and replace the text editor contents with the output
!!          of the filter.  After compiling the filter, the filter line
!!          will start with "!!!Xfilter:", indicating that the filter
!!          was applied.  Delete this line as desired, or type
!!          control-z (or command-z) to undo the compiling process.
