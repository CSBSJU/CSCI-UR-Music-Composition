!!!OTL: Creating a transposing part.
!!
!! Humdrum scores should be encoded at sounding pitch.  A transposition
!! instruction can be given to display transposing parts at written pitch.
!!
!! To create a B-flat part for the following music, add the line:
!!     *ITrd1c2
!! Between the **kern line and the first note.
!!
!! Components of the tandem interpretation:
!!     *I == related to instrumentation
!!     Tr == related to transposition (to generate written pitch)
!!     d1 == transpose up one diatonic step
!!     c2 == which is equivalent to transposing up two chromatic steps
!! Transposition to D-flat would be *ITrd1c1 (one diatonic step/one chromatic step).
